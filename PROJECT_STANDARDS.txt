DO NOT UPDATE CHANGES FOR OTHER PEOPLES SCRIPTS AND OBJECTS, EVEN IF ITS A SMALL CHANGE, WITHOUT ASKING THEM!!!
DO NOT MOVE SCRIPTS TO DIFFERENT FOLDER THAT ARE NOT YOURS. ALWAYS ASK FOR PERMISSION REGARDLESS OF HOW SMALL THE CHANGE!!

-------
OBJECTS
-------
 - When looking to test a new script or whatever it may be, Create a duplicate object that begins with your name (regardless of the object). 
   This new object will be yours and yours only for any further tests. We do this to prevent merge issues!

	|  e.g Will_PlayerTest  |
	|  e.g Ben_PlayerTest   |
	|  e.g Richard_Castle   |

-------
SCRIPTS
-------

 - All Script Names Must Start with "Script_" And End With "_FirstNameInitial".

 	|  e.g Script_CharacterMotor_W  |    <- Where "W" Stands For William

 - All PRIVATE Member Variables Must Start With "m_"

 	|  e.g m_fMovementSpeed  |

- All Public Member Variables Do Not Need "m_"

	|  e.g fMovementSpeed  |	

-------
FOLDERS
-------
 - All Scripts, images, objects, scenes, e.t.c Must be inside a folder with the corresponding name.

 - If We have many diffrent scripts for the same object, Create a sub-folder and place the scripts in there.

	|  e.g Scripts->Player-> Script_CharacterMotor_W  |
	|			 Script_MouseLook_W       |
	|			 e.t.c			  |

-----
NOTES
-----
 - When creating private member variables and you wish to view them in editor, use "[SerializeField]". This will make them visible, NOT EDITIBLE, withought them bieng public.

	|  e.g [SerializeField] private float m_fMaxMoveSpeed  |
