I have made a branch for each person to work on. You will push all of your work into your personal branch.
When your branch is stable and fully functional, only then will you Merge it into main.

--------------------
HOW TO MERGE TO MAIN
--------------------
Current Branch -> Select Main.
Current Branch -> Choose A Branch To Merge Into Main -> Select Your Branch -> Create A Merge Commit
Your Files and changes will now be merged into Main.
